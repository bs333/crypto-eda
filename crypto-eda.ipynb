    "- **Select and Analyze Cryptocurrencies**: Choose five cryptocurrencies based on daily price data from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, and conduct a detailed analysis.\n",
    "- **Price Trend Analysis**: Plot daily price movements and analyze the trends.\n",
    "- **Volatility Assessment**: Calculate daily returns, assess volatility, and identify which cryptocurrency exhibits the most and least variation.\n",
    "- **Correlation Analysis**: Construct a correlation matrix for the cryptocurrencies to explore their interrelationships.\n",
    "- **Market Event Impact Analysis**: Examine the effect of the FTX bankruptcy on selected cryptocurrencies in November 2022.\n",
    "- **Comparative Market Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include a comparison with the S&P 500 index, analyzing similarities and differences in market behavior."

    "- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Known for its smart contract functionality, Ethereum is a primary platform for numerous decentralized applications.\n",
    "- **XRP**: Originally created by Ripple Labs, XRP is known for its digital payment protocol more than its status as a cryptocurrency.\n",
    "- **Dogecoin (DOGE)**: Initially started as a meme, Dogecoin has garnered a significant following and use case in tipping and charitable donations.\n",
    "- **Tether (USDT)**: As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, Tether offers stability in the highly volatile crypto market.\n",
